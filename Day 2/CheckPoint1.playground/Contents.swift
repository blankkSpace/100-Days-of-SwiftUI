//You already know enough to start writing your first useful code, albeit fairly simple: weâ€™re going to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
//
//Your goal is to write a Swift playground that:
//
//Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
//Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
//Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

var tempCel = 28

print("The temprature in cels is \(tempCel), the tempreature in farhenheit is \(tempCel * 9 / 5 + 32)")
